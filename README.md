# Roller-Madness-Unity-3D-Game
A 3D game built using Unity 3D.
Roller Madness is a simple 3D ball rolling game, with coin collection to score and enemy boxes to avoid. Special effort was made to create a user friendly game complete with game UI and in game particle and trail effects. Intelligent enemy boxes will follow you unless you can make them kill each other in the process.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!
